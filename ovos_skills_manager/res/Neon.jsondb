Every match will be announced with the “ding” sound. Then, if requested, those lines that should follow the pattern of `I like *brandname*` are exported to the internal Coupons.py class to generate coupons for discounts and good offers for the user. That request can be made through my-coupons skill. Before generating any new responses, Neon will check with our remote server to see if any new brands became available for processing. This skill is a good demonstration on Neon’s handling for information acquisition and work with the remote server.",

By handling simple phrases like 'pause', this one Skill can turn around and rebroadcast the [messagebus](https://mycroft.ai/documentation/message-bus/) command `mycroft.audio.service.pause`, allowing several music services to share common terminology such as \"pause\". Additionally, this implements the common Play handler.  This allows playback services to negotiate which is best suited to play back a specific request. This capability is used by the [Spotify](https://github.com/forslund/spotify-skill) and [Pandora](https://github.com/mycroftai/pianobar-skill) Skills, among others.",
